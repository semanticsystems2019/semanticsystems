I was sooo looking forward to seeing her ever since I accidentally got to know there was a film. And Lin girl is supposed to be this super fashionable thing that trots around in all the designer labels and walks around like a Queen. Not at all the picture they've portrayed here. And in the book, Rachel doesn't really stand up much to Eleanor. She just try to stay away. And Nick and Rachel fly back to America where they plan to have their wedding which only starts in the second book. And Nick... Nick is to look hot yet this Oxford type guy who's down to earth and uncomfortable about talking about money and stuff.. I dunno.. The story is not at all very accurate but well.. love the lead actress from ""Fresh off the boat"" .. so anything goes..";https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ-YX-5bAs0&lc=UgyiO8YOR0VGqxAtplZ4AaABAg

I didn't care for the scene where ""Dr. Ken""(sorry, just typecasting,) tells his kids to eat up because-""there are starving children in America"". Nope. Not a fan of that line in any way. There are far too many suffering children and this joke was not funny in any way. The entire time I watched this movie all I could think about are all the villagers in Northern China whose villages have been burned down to make way for expensive highrise ghost town communities that enslave elderly farm families who are forced to go into debt $80,000 and up just to live in these giant cold freezing cement kingdoms. And no more family farm for them :( A very sad outcome. So for the poor people of China --- China is still a Communist Country? Yet, for the filthy rich, China is a basic free for all. Hmm. I guess I don't understand any of it. And the Uighers, the Muslims, the Tibetans!(who I adore)--all enslaved, beaten down and supposed to be forgotten about. This movie is what I call a Brain washing Commercial. Can I say that? I am an American. God help us all if this is the future. The Wedding scene was nice. No offense to any Chinese people. I just think it was like ""over the top""--maybe it's just me. The customs being passed down were nice. The movie has good intentions and if you don't know what's really going on in China, then it's fine.";https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ-YX-5bAs0&lc=Ugy_wXA3h1pryt8N0Dx4AaABAg
