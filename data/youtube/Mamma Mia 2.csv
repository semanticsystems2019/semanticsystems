;14-1;Kevin G;28.11.61 15:43:40;0;its a weird timeline but Donna became pregnant in 1979 and gave birth in 1980 Sophie was 20 in 2000 so 2005 is when she would be 25. the trailer there is a mistake it says it takes place in 2015 but really it was 2005.;view comment

32;;Ashshep019;28.11.61 15:43:40;0;Movie takes place in 2015 when Sophie is 25. It shows Donna first went to the island in 1979. (The movie clearly shows in the same summer, she got pregnant) yet in order for Sophie to be 25 in 2015, she would have to be born in 1990 and Donna would have to get pregnant 11 years after she was with Bill Harry and Sam. I’m upset that they could figure out the actual time line of this movie.;view comment
;32-1;Kevin G;28.11.61 15:43:40;0;I hope this answers your question and the timeline. The trailer sets Donna (Meryl Streep)'s pregnancy in 1979, and the birth of Sophie as 1980, which sets Mamma Mia! (2008) around 2000, as Sophie is 20. The movie is set 5 years after the first film, which would make this 2005.;view comment
;32-2;Ashshep019;28.11.61 15:43:40;0;Kevin G the trailer shows that it takes place in 2015 though. Either way I enjoyed the movie, they just didn’t put that much thought into the time line.;view comment
33;;Atilla The Dog Whisperer;28.11.61 15:43:40;1;SPOILER ALERT: I watched this movie recently and as much as I enjoyed it I found many flaws with this movie that I feel must be said: 1.Where are the daughter’s friends?  2.Why does the flashback fathers look nothing like the pictures and hallucinations we get of what the fathers looked like back then in the original? 3.Wasn’t the grandmother a nun? Although yes this answer could be answered pretty simply but still  4. In a flashback we see Donna complaining about how she got her feelings hurt by a boy and then one of her friends makes a joke saying which one, in the original movie the friends had no idea they were other boys except for Sam until Donna told her so?;view comment

97;;Eliana Robinson;28.11.61 15:43:40;0;It’s in the wake of another poisoned story (the second of this year) that has made my fears for HTTYD 3 grow. I lack any confidence (however I will happily eat these words if I’m wrong) that a man determined to make his fans cry with the final DRAGON film won’t succumb to the tragically unfortunate ‘destroy good stories’ craze we seem to have in our film world lately. I hate stories that set up this great, epic story and then tear it down in a sequel (or connecting story) I love the stories that inspire life, hope, courage and above all love. A love of the story, a love of life. Really is needed, agreed, in stories to be believable, but like sugar in a repicy it needs balance. Too much makes it too sweet to little makes it sour. MAMMA MIA 2 was a nice story, good to see the back story, but I found it tried to recreate this epic cake and failed. The music wasn’t as vibrant or inspiriting, it lacked it’s basic and homely quality I loved best about the first and - while I can appreciate a tale about mourning and moving on - I felt this one was too focused on the sad. Leaving many questions unanswered as well. It was too forced and ridged and regretfully I must say; soulless. It had too much sugar for my tastes and sadly falls to the second film this year in a series that negates the great, epic story that came before. I can only hope this growing horrible occurrence in our films burns out before DRAGONS 3 arrives next year, because; though I’ll be open and fair, I WILL NOT hold any punches in my review of DRAGONS 3 if such a soulless, dark and depression craze remains in the last film of the very dearly loved series. I’ve seen the death of two beloved franchises. For the love of Thor! Don’t give us another one. Stories of dark and sad can work but not if it butchers something that was once vibrant, strong and wonderful. That’s too much reality, too much sugar for anyone to swallow.  Making it DRAGON size…well, it will choke this writer half to death.  I can only hope it won’t end that way. Mamma Mia 2 Review By Ej Robinson;view comment

121;;GG Prepper;28.11.61 15:43:40;0;I have never been so disappointed in a prequel in my life until I saw this one. Although it was funny it seemed to be forced funny. Although it was musically talented it seemed to be pushing ABBAs unsuccessful music.  And bringing back everyone was awesome except Donna was only a figment of selfies imagination because they killed her off. And that was something that was totally unnecessary because they could have put her stranded at a ski resort somewhere instead.  But they couldn't put Cher and Meryl Streep side-by-side when Cher looks so much younger than Meryl Streep due to her plastic surgery so there you go.  This is one video I'm not going to waste time and money purchasing.;view comment

183;;K??????? ????????;28.11.61 15:43:40;0;Reasons why this movie doesn't make any sense: 1. So it's been 5 years but Sophie still hasn't had a DNA test to find out who her biological father really is? Or does she find it normal to have 3 dads? 2. Your daughter dies but you don't show up for her funeral or support to your granddaughter and you show up at the party for her pregnancy (or whatever it's about)? 3. 5 years ago you came from England or Ireland or Sweden because you were informed you might have a daughter and 5 years later you still have no interest to find out if she really is your daughter? You just think it's ok to "share" her with two other men? And people find this thing awesome. Whatever...;view comment

251;;Philippa;28.11.61 15:43:40;6;One of the biggest disappointments in movie history. Lazy plot and terrible execution. Nobody asked for this "sequel". If you ask me, I'll stay in my bubble where everyone is happy;view comment
;251-1;Caryn Schmidt;28.11.61 15:43:40;1;Philippa So precisely stated. I was getting depressed with all the comments praising this disastrous, slapped-together mess whose only unifying factor was ABBA songs. Remove the soundtrack and convince me that it's worth the money or time spent.The storyline was abysmal and frankly thoughtless. And everyone knows sequels are nearly guaranteed to be worse.;view comment
;251-2;Chelsea;28.11.61 15:43:40;0;Philippa lol the plot in the first one and the first movie in general was way worse;view comment
;251-3;K. K;28.11.61 15:43:40;0;It was pretty terrible. I hated how they executed the back in time plot line with the young mother. Lily’s acting was very poor and annoying with constant wooos! and hands throwing. I think she did a pretty bad job, I don’t think she was the best choice for this role. The best part of the movie are Lily’s gold boots in the first scene and that’s pretty much it. The whole movie is cringeworthy and flat;view comment

254;;Potato Girl;28.11.61 15:43:40;2;I just know I'm gonna be flipping singing every single singing note in the movie when i watch it XD also: I've always watched Mamma Mia at least 5 times every year. I've been watching it pretty much since I was born, and I thought that it was an old movie and that everybody had  forgotten about it. But apparently not. And when I saw that there was a second movie, I was so, so, SO happy. I know every word to ALL the songs in the first movie, and this one, I'm sure, will be no different. ?... ? (And it is very, VERY,  VERY  rare that I use a ? emoji, so that just shows how much I love this movie.);view comment

307;;Therese Ember;28.11.61 15:43:40;2;There is such an unbelievably sad pall throughout the majority of this film (Meryl Streep not being there).  The entire time, it continuously distracts you, wondering why Meryl pulled out of it (was there a fight between people? money fight? etc.) but then almost near the end (Thank God), Meryl finally shows up (in a short cameo) and an incredibly tender moment happens which literally makes you cry.  But still afterward, you’d been thinking for so long that Meryl Streep had been kicked off (or backed out of) the project that you’d already accepted her as being a  no-show, so it kind of felt ‘too little too late’.  The writer abandoned the audience by killing Meryl’s character off from the very beginning, so you felt deeply upset with the writer for killing her off and making the audience feel depressed for over an hour when you thought it was going to be a fun movie from the start like the first one was.   Amanda Siefried has an exquisitely beautiful voice. Lily James is a stand-out actress.  Colin Firth is hilarious on the boat.  Cher is  amazing as always and her role had great depth.  It’s always great to see Pierce Brosnan.  Gorgeous Greek island set/color design especially in Amanda’s bedroom.  The actress who helped deliver Lily James’ baby is an amazing actress.  This film should have been way more lighthearted and fun starting from the beginning, instead of starting it with bumming the audience out for over an hour and Lily James seeming to have incredibly superficial values at the very beginning. They should have worked on Lily’s backstory story using tons more thought and depth.  Her dialogue was absolutely not believable as a Valedictorian at the beginning. The Abba songs will always be timeless though.  They should reshoot it featuring Meryl at the beginning continually yelling at Lily James “Don’t do it!” at her younger self.;view comment

320;;Winds of March Journey/Perry tribute band;28.11.61 15:43:40;0;"God, I hope his wife is dead..." they gave her and Cher all the best lines, which I'm sure is why they agreed to do the film.  Rita Wilson and Tom Hanks produced this? Seriously? And I was a big fan of the original. It wasn't Citizen Kane, but it was just fun.  Pretty insufferable movie until Cher sang...a TON of Auto-tune in this film, which automatically makes me crazy in a bad way (think: fingernails down a blackboard).  Odd she's supposed to be Meryl's mother when Cher is 3 years older than her.               ****SPOILER*** WHY is Donna/Meryl dead in this movie??? I feel Cher and Meryl's singing are the least messed with digitally.  I think if you don't want to learn to sing right yourself, you ought to step aside and let someone who knows what they're doing do it for you.;view comment
