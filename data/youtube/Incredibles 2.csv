5;;Ag Jr;22.11.18 10:35:24;0;What some people know: This movie was originally supposed to come out next year. What more people don't know: The reason it was moved to this year was because they switched its release date with that of Toy Story 4.;view comment
6;;Aisla Studios;22.11.18 10:35:24;0;I've seen that a lot of people have been like (not aiming towards everyone) '' Jesus this took AGES,''  they probably started making this WHEN THE FIRST MOVIE WAS MADE these things take TIME!

14;;Anon ymous;22.11.18 10:35:24;0;Went and saw the movie today. Unfortunately my hunch was right about it not being as good as the first but i never properly judge a film on the first watch espeiclaly when seen at the cinema. It takes me a few more times to watch it prefrably in the comfort of my own home to fully appreciate/understand the film.  The first film was groundbreaking in both visuals and stroy. One of Pixars finest for sure. Came out of knowhere. Not dissapointing but the fact i fell asleep severla times says it all really. Anyone ever get the cinema to yourself btw? Why is it so hard for me to find an empty screen room? Am i not going often enough? I thought yesterday was the day as i was all alone up until one black guy came and sat in. TBh wasn;t as big of a deal having it to myself more of  anovelty would have been nice htough. Not having to worry about making noise, sitting wher ei want and have more freedom. Choosing which seat i wnated to sit in for th ebest view was great also.;view comment

78;;Joseph Benson;22.11.18 10:35:24;0;I just saw the movie and I have a question. if the villains hypnotizing goggles rely on somebody watching them in order to work. why don't the heroes just close their eyes right before the villains put the goggles on them? I know once they're hypnotized they have no real choice but there's nothing stopping the heroes from just closing their eyes right before the goggles get put on them, pretend like you're hypnotized until they get a chance to rip them off.;view comment

163;;WillBrink;22.11.18 10:35:24;0;If you enjoyed the first one, you'll enjoy the second one, but it lacks something hard to define. The movie attempts to throw everything but the kitchen sink at you, as well as attempt to cover social topics we don't really need addressed in a Disney/Pixar film, and it just tries to hard. CGI is excellent, but unlike the first movie, does not take advantage of it well. Some good dialogue, but too socially awares to just be fun...Two, took them so long to do II, those who enjoyed the first one probably college age by now and "too cool" to watch such things. I had high hopes for this one... B-;view comment

276;;Shadow Crafter;22.02.19 10:35:24;1;I have an Incredibles 3 somewhat plot. So, if you made a trailer, we would either see violet with short hair or Evelyn in jail either trying to break out or with an evil look. Then, we elastigirl ex boyfriend, don't remember his name so I'll say that, anyway I read one of the comic books and her Ex sent a letter to each villain in jail and would soon be free. In more of the trailer we see some of the new supers working together with the incredibles. Possibly the villans were free. But anyhow, Helen probably has gotten a bit more 40 ish and Bob too. Winston and Evelyn also. Violet probably older dash too probably and Jack jack a toddler (able to walk a bit more) I'll think more into it though thanks!;view comment
