111;;Xicor;24.11.19 12:20:34;1;"If a sequal does happen they can use Joker has part og the main cannon and re do some of the movies like batman for example but with this joker story aligned with batman the dark night remastered and do the same with Superman the only difference is the Warner Bros HAVE to go off the comics HAVE to anf get actors that care for there roll because you need the the right story telling for all your characters that will be connected in the same universe for example the Wonder Women sequal need to be good and have a goof story same thing with aquaman 2 Then give each Justice leauge member a movie based on one universe that is in the comics then With the Joker make more villain movies like Joker so if your movies for one year want to focus on batman next you need to build his enimies like Joker maybe Riddler, Killer Croc etc who ever fits the story yoir trying to build, then you got the story of batman down, Next, Superman you have to build his character up into the man he is he cares for life amd wants to protect it not just his wife but everyone and at the same time give him something that he needs to fight to protect everyone because he loves everyone so for example again in one of the movies two kids are filming him on their phone and asking him question but the character is distany and looks annoyed but thats not superman he is more of an open character he would walk torward the kids kneel down and talk to them im a meaningful way. Ok we got 3 big ones down Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman, Next you need to give people like Cyborg a mini series or Movie if needed, Then Green Lantern you need a good actor and mabye a two movie trilogy with them fighting yellow lanters and what ever else has long has it males scence and is part of one story, Thrn comes some tricky situations Martian Manhunter I dont know much about him myself so thats why the story needs to be good either based off comics once again. Ok we got the main heros out of the way lets go back to the Villians Just like Joker we need Movies about them like how I hear there might be a Black Adam Movie it need to be lile Shazam but about a villain and be a little better than Shazam, Thrn you got Black Manta he needs to have no interac yuitons with aquaman but have a story to himself and one that tells us how dangerous he is, Lex Luther need a story like iron man but mor complex because he is like a mix of Iron man and Bruce Wayne, next is Sinestro again font know to much about him you need him to be part of a movie with one other villain, moveing on Killer Frost and Brainiac and the reason gor more Villains than heroes for right now is to give the Jusice leauge the thought that they will loose but that why you add some villians into the story line of some of the heros like Killer Frost, Solomon Grundy and give them a reason why they are part of these teams for the  Justice Leauge Movies to be better so ig you think we have to little heros and villains thats why you have people Like flash and mabye Cheetah off to the side of other movies but are still part of one main movie you understand (and No I dont think Flash should not have a movie in fact a movie about flash would be good for the DCU) Remember that you have to have good directors on these movies that have read more comics than anyone else but can still direct because we dont want Batman useing guns to ruin some great movies and Im not saying the original movies are bad No I enjoyed all the Batman Movies and Thr Superman ones but If the DCU want to have great movies out there they need to work now and start from scratch if they have to because sometimes its what you jave to do because its not about compition its anout how many people enjoy these movies and if we have to wait a long time to get to a Darkside story line just so these movies can be worked on for a while longer it would be worth the wait just remember to get gpod directors that know how to make movies and have read way more than 1 Batman comic get someone that has read all the comics this could redeem the DC frachise into something Greater and more unique than Marvel with Movies bases around Villains Marvel only really has movies on Heros so Warner Bros  its time to go uniqe keep the trend like you did with Joker make DC havr the best Cinamatic universe just like the comics are.

 Our government takes away medication and mental assistance for those who need it most. ONLY when it directly impacts them will they take notice -- then they blame the ones who kill others rather than taking the time to stop the cause. Judges, lawyers, politicians, etc. will continue sucking the life out of the underprivileged as long as it benefits them. By the time they realize the monsters they're creating, there will be no saving them.";https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAGVQLHvwOY&lc=UgySzW6K5ZGCX48a1_Z4AaABAg

 because apart from identifying with him, it only shows that much of our life we ??have lived in chains and sadness, that's why the scene
 
 of the bathroom where something breaks in the comforting, that's why so many things concentrated in one person, who can not imagine or imagine
 
 A secret love sitting next to you when it is not like that but you would like it, who does not cry today when he is old and we say ... if we knew
 
 everything we know today 20 years ago, my person would have been different, but no ... life is like that, so just enjoy these things
 
 that although they are not real they are a space to let the soul cry and feel that we are alive and still feel many things.

Now I heard this one is not as exciting but we shall see I hope. Phoenix both of them are amazing actors of course we or at least I have not seen I believe the younger of the two in years but remember it has been a while since I have seen ALOT of the classics. Got through most of them a few weeks ago such as SAW most Leo movies and of course 2 of my all time favs I will let you guess on that. Lol all the Disney I have seen obviously amazing. Quentin my Hero of course Spielburg anything after Medieval Times Queens and Kings vampires you guys get it. Scottland Ireland All the heritage hopefully one day I will visit all of these ancient places. Even the places lost in bombings in Iraq and Iran Afghan ect. Most Holy/ celebrated places all religions from my last check were actually destroyed by natives of different beliefs in their own countries or bordering countries again it has been a while and I have not done a fact check on that so do not hold me to it any question on it look it up yourself and of course I absolutely adore learning anything new so feel free to drop any input on anything I do write or comment on. Obviously I will not be coming out with anything official for the moment therefore again I would just like to say thank you for everything everyone on my team unofficially or semi officially is doing to make this all happen and of course assisting with going through what I would like to explain as difficult times of course. Thoughts and prayers of course are always welcome and I will deff keep people who wouuld like to know updated I know everyone understands by now I have been way too public and too close for comfort with what I end up doing on social media. It is what I would like to think of as a drunk text when you do that as an adult sometimes however again for obvious reasons I do not mind speaking about I do NOT drink as of before I got to Alaska not that it is against orders just know it is not a good time.  #lovebonnie  Happy Thanksgiving hopefully LIVE soon;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAGVQLHvwOY&lc=UgxYnS3ZlxXAj5EpRwJ4AaABAg

 [practicing his pose backstage, Arthur walks out, doing a dance, to a warm reception by the audience] 
 Murray Franklin: Well, that was quite an entrance. 
 [the audience laughs, as Arthur just sits down staring at the audience] 
 Murray Franklin: You okay? 
 Arthur Fleck: Yeah. This is exactly how I imagined it. 
 Murray Franklin: Well, that makes one of us. 
 [the audience laughs and applauds] 
 Murray Franklin: So, can you tell us about this look? When we spoke earlier, you mentioned that this look is not a political statement. Is that right? 
 Arthur Fleck: That’s, right, Murray. I’m not political. I’m just trying to make people laugh. 
 Murray Franklin: And how’s that going for you? 
 [the audience laughs, and Arthur does his crazy laughter] 
 Murray Franklin: So, I know you’re a comedian. Have you been working on any new material? You want to tell us a joke? 
 [the audience applauds] 
 Arthur Fleck: Yeah? 
 [Arthur takes out his notebook from his back pocket] 
 Murray Franklin: He’s got a book. A book of jokes. 
 [Arthur opens his notebook and looks at a page] 
 Murray Franklin: Take your time, we got all night. 
 [the audience laughs] 
 [looking at his notebook] 
 Arthur Fleck: Okay, okay. Here’s one. Knock, knock. 
 Murray Franklin: And you had to look that up? 
 [the audience laughs] 
 Arthur Fleck: I want to get it right. Knock, knock. 
 Murray Franklin: Who’s there? 
 Arthur Fleck: It’s the police, ma’am. Your son’s been hit by a drunk driver, he’s dead.  
 [Arthur laughs, as the audience sounds aghast] 
 Dr. Sally: Oh, no, no, no. No, you can’t joke about that. 
 Murray Franklin: Yeah, that’s not funny, Arthur. That’s not the kind of humor we do on this show. 
 Arthur Fleck: Okay. Yeah, I’m sorry. It’s just, you know, it’s been a rough few weeks, Murray. Ever since I killed those three Wall Street guys. 
 [pause] 
 Murray Franklin: Okay, I’m waiting for the punchline. 
 Arthur Fleck: There is no punchline. It’s not a joke. 
 Murray Franklin: You’re serious, aren’t you? You’re telling us you killed those three young men on the subway? 
 Arthur Fleck: Mm-hmm. 
 Murray Franklin: And why should we believe you? 
 Arthur Fleck: I’ve got nothing left to lose. Nothing can hurt me anymore. 
 [he smiles] 
 Arthur Fleck: My life is nothing but a comedy. 
 Murray Franklin: Let me get this straight, you think that killing those guys is funny? 
 Arthur Fleck: I do. And I’m tired of pretending it’s not. Comedy is subjective, Murray. Isn’t that what they say? All of you, the system that knows so much, you decide what’s right or wrong. The same way that you decide what’s funny or not. 
 Audience Member: Get him off! 
 Murray Franklin: Okay, I think, my understanding, that you did this to start a movement to become a symbol? 
 Arthur Fleck: Come on, Murray. Do I look like the kind of clown that could start a movement? I killed those guys because they were awful. Everybody is awful these days. It’s enough to make anyone crazy. 
 Murray Franklin: Okay, so that’s it. You’re crazy. That’s your defense for killing three young men? 
 Arthur Fleck: No. They couldn’t carry a tune to save their lives. 
 [the audience starts booing] 
 Arthur Fleck: Oh, why is everybody so upset about these guys? If it was me dying on the sidewalk, you’d walk right over me. I pass you everyday and you don’t notice me! But these guys, what, because Thomas Wayne went and cried about them on TV? 
 Murray Franklin: Do you have a problem with Thomas Wayne? 
 Arthur Fleck: Yes, I do. Have you seen what it’s like out there, Murray? Do you ever actually leave the studio? Everybody just yells and screams at each other. Nobody’s civil anymore! Nobody thinks what it’s like to be the other guy. You think men like Thomas Wayne ever think what it’s like to be someone like me? To be somebody but themselves? They don’t. They think that we’ll just sit down and take it like good little boys! That we won’t werewolf and go wild! 
 Murray Franklin: You finished? I mean, there’s so much self-pity, Arthur, you sound like you’re making excuses for killing those young men. 
 Murray Franklin: Not everybody, and I’ll tell you this, not everyone is awful. 
 Arthur Fleck: But you’re awful, Murray. 
 Murray Franklin: Me? I’m awful? Oh, yeah? How am I awful? 
 Arthur Fleck: Playing my video. Inviting me on this show. You just wanted to make fun of me. You’re just like the rest of them.  
 Murray Franklin: You don’t know the first thing about me, pal. Look what happened because of what you did? What it led to. There are riots out there. Two policemen are in critical condition. 
 [Arthur starts to laugh] 
 Murray Franklin: You’re laughing. You’re laughing. Someone was killed today because of what you did. 
 Arthur Fleck: I know. 
 Arthur Fleck: How about another joke, Murray? 
 Murray Franklin: No, I think we’ve had enough of your jokes. 
 Arthur Fleck: What do you get… 
 Murray Franklin: I don’t think so.
