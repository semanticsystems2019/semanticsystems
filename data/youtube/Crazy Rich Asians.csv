And she looks like she's always dressed in expensive clothes even in the coffee shop scene, so the plot is not very believable.  Also, it is very rare irl for very rich people to date poor people, no matter what everyone says. Usually the rich ones are not only stuck up, but they roam around other rich people.;view comment

I was sooo looking forward to seeing her ever since I accidentally got to know there was a film. And Lin girl is supposed to be this super fashionable thing that trots around in all the designer labels and walks around like a Queen. Not at all the picture they've portrayed here. And in the book, Rachel doesn't really stand up much to Eleanor. She just try to stay away. And Nick and Rachel fly back to America where they plan to have their wedding which only starts in the second book. And Nick... Nick is to look hot yet this Oxford type guy who's down to earth and uncomfortable about talking about money and stuff.. I dunno.. The story is not at all very accurate but well.. love the lead actress from Fresh off the boat .. so anything goes..;view comment

69;;dvg fgt;28.03.19 12:09:48;1;To all the people who say Asians are under represented in Hollywood so are many cultures, even white ones, how often do you get a polish lead in a movie? Or a scottish superhero, the only Scottish superhero in X-Men got an English make over in the new XMen movies.  To be honest the movie industry doesn't care for culture or race, it cares for money.  White Americans make up majority of the population so they target the people that will bring in the most money.  That's why black movies don't become blockbusters, only 12 percent (the Black population) is going to see it. The only reason black panther did well is because it a superhero movie.  It's about supply and demand, nothing to do with culture or race. When the demographics change in America so will the movies being made.  Bollywood is massive so why not do the same thing in other Asians countries?;view comment
;69-1;Ally Granger;28.03.19 12:09:48;0;Lol you must be white. And it's not about what the industry cares for. We need representation, it's as as simple as that. All we see are white people on our screens, we need diversity. Bollywood is not as big as Hollywood and neither are any other niche industries. Hollywood to you may be just an America thing, but Hollywood is a world thing, and it should represent the world and it's population.;view comment

81;;Alexander Faust;28.11.88 15:56:45;0;This is the very highest standard of blatant propaganda issued towards the Asian community imaginable, about what holds value and what does not, in relation to ethnicity and culture.  The majority of these actors aren't even Chinese (who's government is AGGRESSIVELY pushing to take over the industry) and have prominent European features - square jaw lines coupled with high cheek bones, and less slant in the eyes with distinct American or British accents.  Apparently, this is fooling a great deal of people, judging by the profit it has made, in that it's not propaganda, by masquerading as legitimate, modern, Asian culture in a ridiculous fairy tale environment projecting the importance of material wealth over the adoration of tradition (even if tradition should be updated incrementally from time to time).;view comment

101;;Ka Peache;28.11.88 15:56:45;0;Why are people in the comments only focusing only the rich people in the movie? I get that’s the title of the movie but this movie also includes a women who isn’t privileged in the slightest and is just struggling to fit in with boyfriend’s rich family. The main girl even has a mother that went through hardships in her life and so she moved to America. This movie isn’t trying to create a stereotype that all Asians are rich and anyone who thinks that is a dumb bitch that hasn’t watched the movie yet.;view comment

168;;Yasmin McEwen;28.05.19 12:09:48;0;Welcome to Fantasyland, I guess. Unreal. Good solid storyline. I didn't care for the scene where Dr. Ken(sorry, just typecasting,) tells his kids to eat up because-there are starving children in America. Nope. Not a fan of that line in any way. There are far too many suffering children and this joke was not funny in any way. The entire time I watched this movie all I could think about are all the villagers in Northern China whose villages have been burned down to make way for expensive highrise ghost town communities that enslave elderly farm families who are forced to go into debt $80,000 and up just to live in these giant cold freezing cement kingdoms. And no more family farm for them :( A very sad outcome. So for the poor people of China --- China is still a Communist Country? Yet, for the filthy rich, China is a basic free for all. Hmm. I guess I don't understand any of it. And the Uighers, the Muslims, the Tibetans!(who I adore)--all enslaved, beaten down and supposed to be forgotten about. This movie is what I call a Brain washing Commercial. Can I say that? I am an American. God help us all if this is the future. The Wedding scene was nice. No offense to any Chinese people. I just think it was like over the top--maybe it's just me. The customs being passed down were nice. The movie has good intentions and if you don't know what's really going on in China, then it's fine.;view comment

348;;Ipsita Pradhan;28.10.19 12:09:48;0;This is really funny. I like it . But just two things 1.Asians doesn't only represent chinese people 2.why the security people of that rich family are Indians ? I mean if you can take your whole cast chinese then ,choose from them to be security guards also. I feel it's a bit disgraceful towards Indians;view comment

;356-1;ahmad zainuri;28.10.19 12:09:48;0;@Rahul  thanks for inderstanding .. yea im muslim, Indonesian ? most people in eastern part of asia doesnt care about the story of this movie (tbh I think the story is just like Korean soap opera, and I dont like K-Pop culture at all), we can see that the main male cast and his parents have so many physical different, so many people here questioning: how could chinese parents have dayak son (an asian pacific islander) ?, and many other weakness here and there .. but its ok, we r not talking about how good the movie is, we have been represented by this movie .. its like the way black people see black panther movie ..;view comment
;356-2;ahmad zainuri;28.10.19 12:09:48;0;chinese ? ? how did u say that while the main male cast was a dayak (the native people of Borneo island) ? and he has no chinese blood at all.;view comment

;356-4;ahmad zainuri;28.10.19 12:09:48;0;nope, they dont look same .. Henry Golding looks so southeast asian, and the parents look like northeast asian ? so I think its fair enough to say that this movie was representing asia  especially eastern asia;view comment

;356-6;ahmad zainuri;28.10.19 12:09:48;0;@Rahul  most asians look same ? by using that words means u have accepted that this movie represents asia, not only chinese .. u cant find the diference doesnt mean they are all chinese, right ? and the fact is the casts arent chinese only ..;view comment
